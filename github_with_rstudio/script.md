# Hello!

This is an example script that is version-controlled. In this case,
this is markdown, a simple mark-up language for displaying text.

So without further ado here's a poem ....

## The sheep

*The sheep is alone.  
A single white dot,  
in fields green.*

*Its bulking woolen mass,  
tired,  
lays down into earth.*


*Rains fall and suns shine,  
Lives are lived,  
A world which gyrates,  
and gyrates,  
and gyrates.*

*But the sheep is alone.  
A meagre white skull lies,  
in white winter snow.*


## Conflicts please

I expect this line to be a conflict.
